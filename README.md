## Dotfiles
Just my dotfiles.

### Installation
Clone onto your machine:

    git clone git://github.com/sebasoga/dotfiles.git

Install:

    cd dotfiles
    sh install.sh

This will copy config files in your home directory. It will ask you whether you want to overide each file or not.

You can safely run `sh install.sh` multiple times to update.
